# Changelog
All notable changes to this project from version 5.0.0 upwards are documented in this file. 
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [5.0.3] - 2019-09-25

### Added
- Map database views, by default as read-only, but overridable.
- Support non insertable and/or non updatable entities in CRUD actions.
- Support for MariaDB Connector/J.
- Simple automatic JWT renewal (this means that user sessions do not expire during regular user activity).
- Possibility to override buttons in subclasses [[#253]](https://github.com/ManyDesigns/Portofino/issues/253).

### Changed
- JWT expiration property is now called `jwt.expiration`.
- Better Spring context reloading and more rational context layout w/ documentation. Still doesn't support all scenarios.
- Ensure Portofino does not create any HTTP sessions by itself in any circumstances [[#255]](https://github.com/ManyDesigns/Portofino/issues/255). 

### Changed
- Updated Hibernate to version 5.x
    - Session factory is now configured with annotated Java classes generated at runtime.
    - Annotations are propagated from model to annotated classes.
- Guarantee that Portofino 5 can run without a Java compiler (JDK) available.
- Replaced `java.io.File` with Apache Commons VFS `FileObject` in persistence. **This is a breaking API change.**

### Fixed
- Badly broken `Security.groovy`, both the built-in one and ones generated by the wizard.
- `mail.enabled = false` makes the application fail to start.
- CRUD/forms:
   - Form invalid with empty, pristine date fields.
   - Save/update exception not handled properly.
   - Rich text field label misplacement.
   - Passwords visible in search results.
   - Possibility to save configuration with missing required fields.
   - Missing error message for max length in text fields.
   - IDs with spaces cause exception [[#254]](https://github.com/ManyDesigns/Portofino/issues/254).

## [5.0.2] - 2019-08-29

### Added
- Restored and extended some Portofino 4 features:
    - Numbers and dates can be searched with ranges as well as with an exact value.
    - Text properties can be searched with various operators (contains, equals, starts-with and ends-with).
    - Sign up, change password and forgot password dialogs and REST methods.
    - Password fields can ask to confirm the password (i.e., to type it twice).
- Improve developer experience with better code reloading:
    - Quartz jobs are reloaded automatically when the code changes, without restarting the application,
      and, when they terminate execution, any open Hibernate sessions are closed even in case of exceptions.
    - When source code changes, the user-defined Spring context is refreshed, so that services and actions can pick up the changes.
      This only works with classes annotated `@Component`, `@Repository` or `@Service`, to avoid excessive refreshes.
- When embedded, the crud page has now the option to open the detail in the same page instead of navigating to the detail URL.
- Check for new versions at startup.
- Make the JWT expiration time configurable (in minutes, defaults to 30).

### Changed
- UI improvements:
    - Improve looks by drawing inspiration from [sb-admin-material](https://github.com/start-javascript/sb-admin-material).
    - Use Material Typography.
    - The user declining to log in is sent back to the home. The current page has a chance to inject another behaviour.
    - Support the `multiplier` property of the `@DecimalFormat` annotation (for percent, per mille and similar).
    - The rich text component is better integrated in Material forms.
    - More comprehensive detection of links in text fields with `@HighlightLinks`.
    - The page settings panel is reachable via the URL, by including the query parameter `settings`.
- Important dependencies updated: Angular, Groovy, Liquibase, Shiro.

### Fixed
- Select fields with no value or disabled showing nothing or `undefined`.
- Create new page at the top level.
- Toolbar overflowing on mobile.
- Support BigInteger and BigDecimal properties in the UI.
- Properly save the crud page configuration.
- Use the correct schema name when synchronizing an aliased schema.

### Security
- Improved code quality and security and updated insecure dependencies using automated tools.

## [5.0.1] - 2019-06-07

### Added

- Completed the translation to Italian.
- HQL queries support list parameters (ported from P4).

### Changed

- Logging out redirects to the home page.

### Fixed

- Inconsistent use of schemaName vs actualSchemaName.
- Default field encrypter (ported from P4).
- Many to many selection provider database session (ported from P4).
- Annotations not preserved when saving CRUD configuration and tables.

### Security
- Improved code quality and security using snyk, lgtm and SpotBugs to find vulnerabilities and brittle code.
