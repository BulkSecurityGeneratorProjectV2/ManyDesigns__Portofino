# Portofino 6
## From database to REST API in 30 seconds

Portofino 6 is the next generation of ManyDesigns Portofino, the result of decades of experience in model-driven, less-code applications.

Portofino connects to your databases, constructs an enriched model of your data, and exposes it with a REST API.
Authentication and authorization are built-in or can be provided externally.

Adding new queries with new options amounts to writing configuration files. When new logic is necessary it can be 
integrated with light coding in Groovy or Java (and you can call any other JVM languages, JavaScript included, from those).

Portofino is built on top of Spring and Hibernate and is designed to be a nice citizen in a microservices environment.
